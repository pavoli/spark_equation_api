This code base serves as the trial task for Python developers.

## Code characteristics

* Works on Python py36, py37, py38

## Setting up a development environment

We assume that you have `Pipenv` installed.

    pipenv sync --dev


# Adding settings

Copy the `local_settings_example.py` file to `local_settings.py`.
